## Acknowledgment
We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the following projects, which inspired and provided the foundation for this work:

1. **[Original Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)**: This project introduced the foundational approach to Gaussian Splatting for rendering and scene reconstruction.
2. **[gsplat Open-Source Framework](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat)**: A modular and open-source implementation of Gaussian Splatting designed for research and development in 3D scene reconstruction.
3. **[DUST3R](https://github.com/naver/dust3r?tab=readme-ov-file)**: A powerful framework that combines deep learning with 3D reconstruction tasks for robust and efficient processing.

We are grateful for the hard work and open-source efforts of these teams.
